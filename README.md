## Project Summary

City Spot is a social platform for travellers to showcase their recent trips. This is done by generating a 'post' on a city's show page, which includes:

* an uploaded image
* a brief summary of their experience/caption relating to their image

To increase interactivity amongst the travellers, users can also:

* add a comment to the post
* 'like' the post

10 posts with highest amounts of likes in the database will be featured on a popular posts page, where they are sorted by the amount of likes in descending order. The number of 'likes' are added on the post to visually display this popularity ranking on the page. Users are also able to 'like' the posts they see on that page, and will be navigated to the city's show page when they click on the post.

As well as the posts, the city show pages also includes general city information such as population and region, event and restaurant recommendations, a youtube video of the city and a weekly weather forcast.
 
This was a tool for users to find out information on cities they're planning to go to in the future.

## Users Journey

When the user first visits City Spot, they have two paths to reach their desired city: a search bar, and links to each continent where they can select a city.

The user has a profile page which contains their uploaded profile image, bio, a cover photo and their posts. They are also able to edit their bio and cover photo image.

## Process

### Development
Planning was an integral part the process as our focus was to produce a backend API which could corehently work in the React front-end. We first began creating wireframes to work out this structure and general content placement of the website. It was clear our application would revolve around three elements: User, City and Continent and we established early on that posts will be added to a city's page by a user.

### Backend

We firstly began to develop our backend API using MongoDB, and created three of our main Mongoose models; City, Continent, and User. As the the cities are within a continent catergory, a 'cities' virtual schema was made.

```
continentSchema.virtual('cities', {
  ref: 'City',
  localField: '_id',
  foreignField: 'continent'
})
```
To begin the database, we created a seeds file to add the data for all the Continents and a handful of Cities, which served two purposes: to create routes in the back-end which allowed the front-end to work with the data and as a visual tool, to help populate data when making adjustments to our API, using Insomnia as our client. 

#### Authentication

In order to carry out the authentication process, we used BCrypt to hash passwords in the backend and store it in the database so that BCrypt could compare it against the password given when logging in. We also used JSON Web Token to embed JSON into an encrypted token. This was incorporated in our login and register controller and is sent to the client when the users successfully authenticate. 

Upon registering, we used Nodemailer to send an email to the users email which includes a link to verify the email they have registered with. The users are notified on the front-end by a flash message. 
To experiement with Nodemailer and BCrypt even further, we also added a reset password option for users who have forgotten their password. The link navigates to a route where they input a new password which is undergoes the same backend process as the initial password setup.

### Frontend
Frontend setup

One of the other developers and I worked on setting up the front-end of the project. We started by splitting the components and working on these separately. I worked on the City Index page, the Home page and the Continents Show page, while the other developer concentrated on the form pages.

### APIs

One of my tasks was to incorporate external APIs into the project, and I decided to make to API calls on the backend to ensure our app ran as fast and efficiently as it could. First I used a combination of two APIS; Open Cage and Dark Sky API's to first get the latitude and longitude of each city, and then pass these through into the API call to Dark Sky to get the weather information for that location.

### Task Management and Communication

Being in a team of four, we decided the easiest way to divide the workload was to have two people build the front-end, and two people build the back-end. We held stand-ups every morning and communicated via Slack to update each other with our progress.

## Styling

We used Semantic UI as our CSS Framework which created a sleek and user friendly design. 

## Challenges and Wins
Challenges:
* email system

Wins:

One of the biggest wins was the team communication. We had a group Slack channel where every member was equally active. This really helped us manage Git as a team, as we all got into the habit of informing each other when we were pushing to the development branch. Any errors or conflicts during this process, we notified the group channel where we all worked together to resolve the issue.


## Future features

* Currently, the only way to add new Cities is via our seeds file, so an admin account to add the cities will be a useful feature to add.

* To follow the conventions of a social media platform, and for users to engage with each other to have a sense of community, I'd like to implement user messaging & friend requests.

* A search bar for the Continent and City pages to improve user navigation.
